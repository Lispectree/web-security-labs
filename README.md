This repository is where I document my progress through **PortSwigger’s Web Security Academy labs** — a hands-on platform for understanding web vulnerabilities.

## What This Project Is About
This repository contains:
- ✍️ **Writeups** for each Web Security Academy lab I complete  
- 🖼️ **Screenshots** showing important steps   
- 🧰 **Payloads or snippets** I used to solve challenges (sanitized)  
- 🛡️ **Mitigations & lessons learned** so I don’t just exploit, but also think about defense  

You’ll find lab-specific content inside the `labs/` folder.

## Why I’m Doing This
- To strengthen my understanding of **web security vulnerabilities**
